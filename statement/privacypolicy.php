							information very seriously. As such, we have prepared the
							following Privacy Statement to provide you with information about
							how your data is collected, used, stored, shared, transferred,
							and protected as a result of your interaction with and use of
							Psomagen’s products, software, services, (the “Service” or
							“Services”), and website located at </span><a href="http://www.mypsomagen.com/?__hstc=85405446.9891583298bbd0022bdb56572f766eba.1666104924019.1670536138522.1673641786772.16&amp;__hssc=85405446.2.1673641786772&amp;__hsfp=4036662860"><b>https://psomagen.com/</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Site”), which is owned

					<p>
						<span style="font-weight: 400;">Psomagen is not considered

							electronically. In the event that Psomagen becomes a covered
							entity, Psomagen shall revise this Privacy Statement as needed to
							comply with HIPAA and shall make available a notice of privacy
							practices as required under HIPAA. Although Psomagen is not
							obligated to comply with HIPAA, it is obligated under state law
							and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), to the
							extent it is applicable, to protect the privacy and security of
							personal information entrusted to it. Psomagen prohibits the
							unauthorized disclosure of such information except as required by
							law.</span>
